# GlobalTime Clock Text Changer

[GlobalTime](https://www.ntpclock.com/) clocks come with a program that can unicast or broadcast to change clock messages, but not selectively cast.

With this program you can write "scripts" to send specific messages to different lists of clocks.

(It has only been tested with the [2.3" 6-Digit PoE Clock](https://www.ntpclock.com/productinfo/368428.html).)
